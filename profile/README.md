# 👋 Welcome to APASLab on GitHub

Welcome to the official GitHub organization of the Artificial Perception and Autonomous Systems Lab (APASLab) at the University of Rijeka, Faculty of Engineering.

## What we do

Our research and projects cover a wide range of topics including:
- Computer vision and perception for robotics
- Machine learning and AI applications
- Privacy-preserving technologies
- Distributed systems

## Why this GitHub organization?

Many of our students, researchers, and collaborators develop software and prototypes as part of their studies or research.
To make this knowledge accessible and encourage collaboration, we created this organization as a central home for all our projects.

## Let's connect!
